    <p style="text-align: center;"> Below is a collection of projects that I've accomplished. Feel free to scroll through them!!</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">Personal Website</h3>
    <div class="mybox">
        During my 12th grade summer as I was preparing to make the transition to enter college I decided to make a personal website to better highight all my skills and techniques. I broke it down into multiple sections including a home, experience, projects, quotes and resume section. Doing this assignment is actually very reminiscent of the that project as some of the reqiurements are very similar. So all in all it worked out. Here is the link to the website <a href="motmot21.github.io">motmot21.github.io</a>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">French revolution</h3>
    <div class="mybox">
        Okay the idea behind french revolution was that I didn't want to buy a nanny cam to watch my room when I got to college. To prevent myself from having to buy one I spent time coding to turn my webcam monitor into a nanny cam. As i unfortunaly lost the code due to time here are some links and references that can help you envision what the project would have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/14ljqek/software_solutions_to_turn_desktop_webcam_into_a/">Reddit-post</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUjIJNHXg5k&themeRefresh=1"> Youtube-Video</a><a href="https://www.eufy.com/blogs/security-camera/how-to-use-webcam-as-security-camera"> Document</a>

     <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">Ip Sweeper</h3>
    <div class="mybox">
      When I was in highschool I spent a lot of time studying to obtain my cybersecurity certifications that I sho off in another slide. As a result of this practice I spent time trying to further develop tools and this website is a product of that. Like the website before hand it has been lost with the passage of time however I do have some links that can help the viewer conceptualize this: <a href="https://usmcdennis0331.medium.com/creating-a-basic-ip-sweeper-with-bash-6a6b91a629f2">Documentation</a><a href="https://github.com/CYBWithFlourish/IP-Sweeper-Script"> Github</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kalilinux/comments/16tezt2/having_trouble_creating_a_basic_ip_sweeping/"> Github</a>
